# Behaviour analytics made easy !

*Aktable.js is meant to collect visitor behaviour when he/she/it visits a web-page*

## Why ?

* Form layout A/B testing. An ideal ordering of form elements can be found analysing behavioural data gathered from users filling it.
* Multi-form process analytics. Where most of the users leave the process ? Do they review any particular step ? and a lot of useful intelligence that can be extracted
* You can find your way to use it !

## How ?

Aktable.js is just a wrapper that captures page events and format it to JSON format. It can be configured to send this data to any webhook URL.

## Analytics with intent

What makes Aktable different from other analysics tools is that we designed it to be more than a generic tool. Most analytics libraries collect all data availables and tries to find a way to extract useful intelligence within. Aktable instead enforces you to focus on what you want to know, for example analysing a form filling behaviour and leave out all the rest (links, ads, etc)
